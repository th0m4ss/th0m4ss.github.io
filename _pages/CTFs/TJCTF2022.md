I haven'e done a CTFs in a while, until a friend hit me up saying we should try this year's [TFCTF](https://tjctf.org/).
We competed as the team [me_irl](https://ctftime.org/team/185568) and finished at 33rd place.

Overall, there were lots of fun and interesting challenges and I had a lot of fun doing this one.

Below are the writeups for each of the challenges I was able to complete.
